# Ideabox
---
#### By Isaac Sunoo & Mike Krog

## Project Description
Ideabox is an app that allows someone to post their ideas into localstorage and have the ability to rate them based on the quality of that idea.  The site is fully responsive and has full CRUD operations. It shows 10 cards in the array and has the ability to show more or show less as well.  It is a great app for someone to use and store their thoughts, so they will never forget.

## Learning Experience
This project was a learning experience to improve on building a client-side application with good user feedback as well as understanding how to implement client-side data persistence using localstorage. We experienced first hand on how to separate a data model and a dom model and iterated over dom elements in order to filter what is being displayed.
